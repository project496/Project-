# Project-
The Employee Management System is a Java Swing-based desktop application that allows users to efficiently manage employee records. It provides essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities, enabling HR personnel or managers to add new employees, update existing records, view employee details, and remove employees from the database.

The system is built using Java Swing for the GUI and integrates with a MySQL database for data storage. It follows an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach, ensuring a modular and maintainable code structure.
